# Remote FTC
## Intro
This is meant to be a project to help teams that have team members quanatined but still iwsh to be able to host driver practice remotely.
# How do I use it?
1. Have the driver either visit [this hosted copy](https://remoteftc.lavallee.one) or host your own
2. Have the proxy computer download the .exe from the releases section of github or build your own **NOTE**: this computer must both be able to access the internet and connect to the robot at the same time. This probably means having both an ethernet connection to your router and connecting to the robot's wifi at the same time
3. Have the driver click on the controller icon and the proxy click on the proxy icon
4. Profit?
