# Remote FTC
## Intro
This is meant to be a project to help teams that have team members quanatined but still wish to be able to host driver practice remotely. It allows a driver to control the robot remotely, from another location.
# How do I use it?
1. Have the driver either visit [this hosted copy](https://remoteftc.lavallee.one) or host your own
2. Have the proxy computer download the .exe from the releases section of github or build your own **NOTE**: this computer must both be able to access the internet and connect to the robot at the same time. While making this project, we did this by connecting with ethernet to the internet, and connecting with wifi to the robot, though other options may exist.
3. Have the driver click on the controller icon and the proxy click on the proxy icon
4. *(Alex put a step in here about typing in the code and whatever else you have to do to run a class, etc.)*
5. While driving, use a video calling app for the driver to see the robot. This project does not have a camera view of the robot.
